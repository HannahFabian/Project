Development log

The process of creating our project involved going through several complications, from proposing an initial idea of ​​how the page interface should look 
and the main purpose of it, to directly how to build it so it would achieve our goals and expectations.

Almost all the features and design that were used to create the website came about through brainstorming between the two of us.		
The process was basically putting all the ideas and proposals on the table and then discarding those that didn't seem so good to us. 
This first moment didn't involve any major inconvenience, since we were quite sure and in agreement about the general objective that we wanted to achieve through our project, as well as the approach that we wanted to give it with respect to the UN objective that we chose.

The next step was to start programming. Having a clear enough idea to start with, it wasn't such a tedious activity either, 
and part of the functions and style that we decided to give to the project were obtained by mixing functions that we each use in our own portfolios, 
so we were already familiar with the main functions.	However, this doesn't mean that we haven't had difficulties. On several occasions, 
when we wanted to check that everything was in order, we noticed that some of the functions that we had added to make the page more stylish 
didn't work or weren't activated when we needed them; in the same way, our page makes use of a lot of links and connections, so on more than one occasion
we forgot to close them properly, or we put them in the wrong places, causing failures. But between the two of us and with a lot of careful observation, 
we managed to identify these errors and correct them.

We think that time was also a factor that worked against us during this delivery, since having other projects plus the exams made it difficult
to find a suitable time to meet to discuss and work on the creation of the page; however, we are a good team, so we eventually found a way to get the work done, and we intend to continue doing so until the final delivery.



*Personal log* - Mariem

This is not the first time I've worked with Hannah, and we've always been a great team. We both have ideas that complement each other, and the results are usually satisfactory for both parties. Although on this occasion, due to scheduling issues, it was a little more complicated to coincide to do the work, since in our opinion it was easier to collaborate in person than online, we managed to finish the first part of the project on time.

As for the division of labor, I usually contribute mostly by structuring our ideas and giving a clearer vision of what we want to achieve, as well as researching extra elements that we may need, whether it be information or guides on how to develop a particular function. Hannah usually takes care of more programming, she's more organized in that regard, I've learned a lot by helping her program.

And between the two of us we usually give it the stylization and design that we want, we both like to draw and design a lot, so we tend to be somewhat ambitious in that aspect.
