Development log #2

This second delivery was similar to the first in terms of it being a bit complicated to organize ourselves in time to be able to move forward together in the work, since our activities got in the way. However, we had the advantage that part of what was requested in the delivery of this second partial in terms of the design and animations made with js we had already thought about and done for the first delivery.

For this installment, Hannah took care of the backend, while I did the research for the different elements we needed to complete our project. On the other hand, I took care of the frontend for some sections we still had pending, such as the main objective section of the work and some extra decorations.

We had a few issues along the way, for example, when accommodating our previous files with the elements required by Express, sometimes the page could not access certain elements or we had to change the addresses; but in the end, we managed to get the page working as it should using the new functions.

Personally, I am pleased with what Hannah and I achieved for this delivery. Again, I think our biggest enemy was time and the hassle of getting organized to be able to work together. However, I think we were capable to manage well, we supported each other in what each had to do when it was necessary and in the end we managed to make the progress we wanted for the delivery.
I have quite a lot of ambition and expectations for our final delivery.
